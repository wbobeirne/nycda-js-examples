# Basic Javascript Examples

This repository just contains a few examples of basic code. There're examples
for variables, conditionals, functions, and loops. To see them in action, just
open the HTML file, un-comment out the script you want to see run, and open the
page. They mostly log to the console, so make sure you have that open!
